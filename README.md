# 🛡️ Social Distance Detection

An **AI-powered social distancing violation detection system** built using **YOLO object detection**.  
It detects people in real-time from video feeds, calculates pairwise distances, and flags violations where the distance is below a defined threshold.  
Supports **CPU** and **GPU** execution, works with CCTV/drone footage, and outputs annotated videos with violations highlighted in red.
